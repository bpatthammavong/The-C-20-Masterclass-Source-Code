How to create the new txt file for git
1/. Create the '.txt' file:

Linux/macOS(Terminal):
touch my_new_file.txt  # Creates an empty file
echo "Some initial content" > my_new_file.txt  # Creates the file and adds content
nano my_new_file.txt  # Opens the file in the nano text editor
vi my_new_file.txt    # Opens the file in the vi/vim text editor

**********************************************************************

Windows(Command Prompt):
type nul > my_new_file.txt  # Creates an empty file
echo "Some initial content" > my_new_file.txt  # Creates/overwrites and adds content
notepad my_new_file.txt  # Opens the file in Notepad

***************************************************************************

Window (powershell):
New-Item -ItemType file -Path my_new_file.txt  # Creates an empty file
"Some initial content" | Out-File -FilePath my_new_file.txt  # Creates/overwrites and adds content
notepad my_new_file.txt  # Opens the file in Notepad

******************************************************************************

2/. Stage the new file in Git:

Once you've created the file, you need to tell Git to start tracking it. This is done using git add:
git add my_new_file.txt
git add my_new_file.txt: This command stages the new file, adding it to the index (the staging area).


3. Commit the Changes:

After staging the file, commit it to your local Git repository:
git commit -m "Add my_new_file.txt"

"git commit -m "Add my_new_file.txt": This command creates a new commit, saving the changes (the addition of the file) to your local repository's history.

4. Push the Changes (Optional):

If you want to share the new file with others or back it up to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket), you need to push the commit:

git push origin <branch_name>


git push origin <branch_name>: This command pushes the commit (and the new file) to the remote repository. Replace <branch_name> with the name of your branch (e.g., main, master, develop).
Complete Example (Linux/macOS):


# 1. Create the file:
touch my_new_file.txt
echo "This is some content for my new file." > my_new_file.txt

# 2. Stage the file:
git add my_new_file.txt

# 3. Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Add my_new_file.txt"

# 4. Push the changes (optional):
git push origin main


Explanation:

touch my_new_file.txt creates an empty .txt file named my_new_file.txt.
echo "This is some content for my new file." > my_new_file.txt adds the text "This is some content for my new file." to the my_new_file.txt file. If the file already exists, this will overwrite its contents. Use >> to append to the end of an existing file instead.
git add my_new_file.txt adds the file to the staging area.
git commit -m "Add my_new_file.txt" commits the staged changes with a descriptive message.
git push origin main pushes the commit to the main branch on the remote repository.
Key Takeaways:

Git doesn't create files directly. You use OS commands or text editors to create them.
You must use git add to stage the new file before committing.
Commit messages are important. They should briefly describe what the commit does.
git push is needed to share your changes with others.
